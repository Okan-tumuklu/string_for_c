Dynamic String Input and Memory Management
This C code allows the user to dynamically input a string and efficiently manages memory. The get_string function reads characters entered by the user and reallocates memory as needed, expanding it when the input size exceeds the initial allocation. This approach prevents memory wastage and provides flexibility for handling user inputs when the length of the string is unknown in advance.

Features:
Dynamic Memory Management: Adjusts the amount of memory dynamically based on user input, preventing memory wastage.
Error Handling: Provides error messages and terminates the program if memory allocation or reallocation fails.
User-Friendly: Prompts the user with a clear message to enter a string.
This project serves as a good example for those looking to learn about dynamic memory management and basic string handling in C.
